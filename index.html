  <p>I am a PhD student in the Comparative Biology program at the Richard Gilder Graduate School (RGGS) at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH).</p> 
  <p>I am an invertebrate paleobiologist with an interest in understanding how periods of climate change influence ecosystems and communities. My dissertation examines nearshore marine mollusk communities of Plio-Pleistocene age (5 - 1.8mya) in order to determine the magnitude of faunal changes during the Pliocene warm period and subsequent cooling thereafter. I also utilize ocean biogeochemistry and stable isotopes to determine which environmental changes may be behind observed community changes.
