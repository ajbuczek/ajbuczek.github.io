  <p>Marine molluskan community responses to Pliocene climate change have been studied in both the Atlantic and Pacific but the northwestern Pacific still remains unstudied. No studies have offered a quantitative analysis of community structure change or have included paleoenvironmental analyses to provide context to observed ecological changes. I propose to analyze the response of marine mollusk communities to late Pliocene warming on the coast of Claifornia and determine the environmental drivers behind observed responses using stable isotope analyses.

  <h3><a href="Tritylodontids.pdf">AMNH Research Internship</a>, Summer 2015</h3> 
  <p>I spent one month describing two new genera and species of Tritylodontidae, Shartegodon altai and Nuurtherium baruunensis, and compared them with other known tritylodontids using <a href = "https://morphobank.org/">Morphobank</a> and CT reconstructions.

  <h3>AMNH Research Experience for Undergraduates, Summer 2014</h3> 
  <p>I coded dental and cranial characters of three Mesozoic-age mammals from the Gobi of Mongolia in the <a href = "https://morphobank.org/">Morphobank</a> matrix originally created for the <a href = "http://science.sciencemag.org/content/339/6120/662">O'Leary et al., 2013</a> paper on the radiation of placental mammals following the KPg in order to determine the placement of these taxa within the larger placental phylogeny. I also utilized CT scanning and reconstruction to discover intracranial characters. <i> For more information on this research, including results and methodology, please contact me.</i></p>
