  <p>Marine molluskan community responses to Pliocene climate change have been studied in both the Atlantic and Pacific but the northwestern Pacific still remains unstudied. No studies have offered a quantitative analysis of community structure change or have included paleoenvironmental analyses to provide context to observed ecological changes. I propose to analyze the response of marine mollusk communities to late Pliocene warming on the coast of Claifornia and determine the environmental drivers behind observed responses using stable isotope analyses. </p>

  <p>I spent one month describing two new genera and species of Tritylodontidae, Shartegodon altai and Nuurtherium baruunensis, and compared them with other known tritylodontids using <a href = "https://morphobank.org/">Morphobank</a> and CT reconstructions.</p>

  <p>I coded dental and cranial characters of three Mesozoic-age mammals from the Gobi of Mongolia in the Morphobank matrix originally created for the O'Leary et al., 2013 paper on the radiation of placental mammals following the KPg in order to determine the placement of these taxa within the larger placental phylogeny. I also utilized CT scanning and reconstruction to discover intracranial characters.</p>
