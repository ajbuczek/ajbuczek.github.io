  <p>Marine molluskan community responses to Pliocene climate change have been studied in both the Atlantic and Pacific but the northwestern Pacific still remains unstudied. No studies have offered a quantitative analysis of community structure change or have included paleoenvironmental analyses to provide context to observed ecological changes. I propose to analyze the response of marine mollusk communities to late Pliocene warming on the coast of Claifornia and determine the environmental drivers behind observed responses using stable isotope analyses. </p>

  <p>I spent one month describing two new genera and species of Tritylodontidae, Shartegodon altai and Nuurtherium baruunensis, and compared them with other known tritylodontids using <a href = "https://morphobank.org/">Morphobank</a> and CT reconstructions.</p>
