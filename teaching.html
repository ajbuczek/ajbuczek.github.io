    <h3> Lang High School Mollusks Research Course </h3> 
    <p> The <a href="https://www.amnh.org/learn-teach/children-and-families/amnh-lang-science-program">AMNH Lang Science Program</a> is a 7-year intensive extracurricular science program in which selected students can experience the Museum sciences through hands-on activities with visiting scientists and courses specifically tailored to introduce students to scientific research.</p>
    <p> In the summer and fall of 2018, I co-taught a high school level research course for the Lang Program focused on Mollusks. With a fossil record that spans 540 million years, mollusks offer opportunities to understand the evolution of marine ecosystems over the entire span of known animal life. Fossil mollusks are abundant, well-preserved, and hold signs of previous environmental conditions in the chemistry of their shells, making them invaluable to paleontologists interested in studying periods of climate change in Earth history. 
    As a part of this research team, we studied the ecology, habitats, and evolutionary history of mollusks. We got our hands dirty sorting through 2-million-year-old mollusk fossils from San Diego, California and used them to determine how the marine ecosystems changed during a period of rapid climate change in the Pliocene period (5.3-2.58 mya). Through this research project, students gained insight into how paleontologists use fossils to understand the climate of the past and how it shaped the ecosystems preserved in the rock record.<p>
