    <p> In the summer and fall of 2018, I co-taught a high school level research course for the Lang Program focused on Mollusks. With a fossil record that spans 540 million years, mollusks offer opportunities to understand the evolution of marine ecosystems over the entire span of known animal life. Fossil mollusks are abundant, well-preserved, and hold signs of previous environmental conditions in the chemistry of their shells, making them invaluable to paleontologists interested in studying periods of climate change in Earth history. 
    As a part of this research team, we studied the ecology, habitats, and evolutionary history of mollusks. We got our hands dirty sorting through 2-million-year-old mollusk fossils from San Diego, California and used them to determine how the marine ecosystems changed during a period of rapid climate change in the Pliocene period (5.3-2.58 mya). Through this research project, students gained insight into how paleontologists use fossils to understand the climate of the past and how it shaped the ecosystems preserved in the rock record.</p>
    <p> Lectures focused on general community ecology, specific mollusk ecology including tiering, mobility, and feeding strategy, geology and stratigraphy, as well as climate change in the Pliocene as well as the present. Students learned how to identify mollusk species by morphological traits using hands on activities with both modern samples from the AMNH teaching collections as well as material collected from the San Diego Formation. Other hands-on learning activities included reading and analyzing scientific literature, using the <a href = "https://paleobiodb.org/#/">Paleobiology Database</a> to determine the ecology of fossil species, using the <a href = "https://www.flickr.com/photos/lacmip/">LACMIP Flickr libraray<a> to identify fossil species based on morphological traits, analyzing species abundance data using basic statistics and bar graphs.</p>
    <p> Students formed their own research questions on the ecology of marine mollusk communities in the Pliocene San Diego basin which they answered through hands-on lab work in which they sorted bulk samples of fossils collected from the San Diego basin by species, identified species, counted abundances, partitioned data into ecological groups, ran basic statistical analyses and created bar graphs using Microsoft Excel, and analyzed results and came to conclusions using databases and knowledge gathered from previous lectures and activities. Students summarized their methods, results, and conclusions in scientific posters which they presented during the Lang research symposium in December. During the symposium, students communicated their findings to the general public as well as other museum researchers and New York City educators. </p>
