  </div>    <p>Cenozoic climate change drove faunal turnover not only on land, but also in the sea.
Along with many environmental changes witnessed in the Cenozoic, the late Pliocene
(Piacenzian, 3.6-2.58Ma) warming is regarded as a good analogue for modern climate
change. The Piacenzian warming has been cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as “the most recent interval of geological time when mean global temperatures were
~2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial temperatures for a sustained period” and are therefore
comparable to those temperatures projected to occur within the next fifty years. By the late
Pliocene, continents and ocean basins were already in their present geographic configuration
and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (360 - 400 ppm) were at the same level as the modern.
The Pliocene, therefore, offers a unique chance to examine the response of biotic systems to a
similar warming as that predicted for the future.
Coastal ecosystems are highly productive as well as
rich in biodiversity and economic resources. These
ecosystems have experienced more severe environmental
changes with modern global warming as compared to open
ocean systems and are critical to study in the fossil
record in order to establish a guideline for future
      environmental and ecological change. </p>
      <p>Mollusks are a
particularly important study group within these ecosystems
due to their taphonomic durability, abundance in the fossil
record, and habitat suitability which is strongly dependent
on multiple ecological factors such as productivity,
temperature, and salinity. Using ordination analyses of molluscan fossil assemblages, the environmental drivers shaping
        faunal distribution can be determined. My dissertation focuses on analyzing the differences in marine mollusk
communities during the Plio-Pleistocene in Southern California in order to determine the
      environmental gradients driving community differences within and between geological formations during a period of climate change.</p>

    <li>On the Reconciliation of Biostratigraphy and Strontium Isotope </li> 
      Stratigraphy of Three Southern Californian Plio-Pleistocene Formations 
<p>In order to achieve this primary goal, it was necessary first to constrain the ages of the three formations of interest using an isotopic data method. Former studies primarily used macrofossil biostratigraphy to assign ages to the the Plio-Pleistocene formations. These methods 
      are inaccurate and low resolution. In order to assign higher resolution ages to formations in order to provide climatic context
      to all assemblages, strontium isotope stratigraphy of molluscan carbonate was used.
