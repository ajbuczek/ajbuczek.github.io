  </div>    <p>Cenozoic climate change drove faunal turnover not only on land, but also in the sea.
Along with many environmental changes witnessed in the Cenozoic, the late Pliocene
(Piacenzian, 3.6-2.58Ma) warming is regarded as a good analogue for modern climate
change. The Piacenzian warming has been cited by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change as “the most recent interval of geological time when mean global temperatures were
~2°C to 3°C above pre-industrial temperatures for a sustained period” and are therefore
comparable to those temperatures projected to occur within the next fifty years. By the late
Pliocene, continents and ocean basins were already in their present geographic configuration
and atmospheric CO2 concentrations (360 - 400 ppm) were at the same level as the modern.
The Pliocene, therefore, offers a unique chance to examine the response of biotic systems to a
similar warming as that predicted for the future.
Coastal ecosystems are highly productive as well as
rich in biodiversity and economic resources. These
ecosystems have experienced more severe environmental
changes with modern global warming as compared to open
ocean systems and are critical to study in the fossil
record in order to establish a guideline for future
      environmental and ecological change. </p>
      <p>Mollusks are a
particularly important study group within these ecosystems
due to their taphonomic durability, abundance in the fossil
record, and habitat suitability which is strongly dependent
on multiple ecological factors such as productivity,
temperature, and salinity. In the right taphonomic and
stratigraphic circumstances, the molluskan fossil record
allows for the construction of time-series of community
structure. Mollusk shells can also be used to construct time
series of environmental change as stable isotopes are
incorporated into molluskan shell microstructure from
surrounding seawater, preserving an isotopic signal
reflective of the environmental conditions at the time of shell
formation. The aforementioned characteristics of
mollusks make them the ideal study organism for
understanding the response of coastal ecosystems to
climate change and the environmental drivers behind that
        response.</p>
<p>Marine molluskan community responses to Pliocene
climate change have been studied in the Caribbean and in
New Zealand, showing evidence of extinction and faunal
turnover in both the Atlantic and western Pacific in
response to warming. The coast of the northeastern Pacific still remains a gap in marine
Pliocene paleoecological and paleoenvironmental studies. While the immigration of warm water
taxa into Californian waters during the Pliocene has been reported, no studies have offered a
quantitative analysis of community structure change over the late Pliocene warming.
Furthermore, no studies have attempted to include paleoenvironmental analyses to provide
  context to observed ecological changes.</p>
<p>My dissertation focuses on analyzing the response of marine mollusk
communities to late Pliocene warming down the coast of California and determining the
      environmental drivers behind observed responses using stable isotopic analyses.</p>
